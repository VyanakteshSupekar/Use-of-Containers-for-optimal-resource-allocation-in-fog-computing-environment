# Use-of-Containers-for-optimal-resource-allocation-in-fog-computing-environment
In this two scenarios are developed one is use of containers for resource allocation in fog computing and the other one is resource allocation in fog comptuing without using containers. To execute this files extract all the files in one folder and import that folder in IDE's like netbeans, eclipse. Then execute the file "withContainers.java" for first scenario and "withoutContainers.java" for second scenario. You can refer to this link for execution steps in detail : https://youtu.be/dcJsnl-DXK4.
